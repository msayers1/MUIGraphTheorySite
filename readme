# Graph Theory Pedagogic Tool 

Graph Theory Pedagogic Tool  is an under-construction tool to enable visualization and teaching
of graph theory concepts and algorithms.

This is a work that furthers the work by NEERAJ ADHIKARI and you can see the code @  https://github.com/nradk/gtpg or app @ [neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-playground](https://neerajadh.gitlab.io/graph-playground/#).

Please be warned that the project is still very much in it's infancy and there
are a lot of things missing and things that do not work.


### Implemented Features
- Undirected and directed graph creation
- Weighted graphs
- Tool-based design with tools to delete objects, add/edit and move objects
